# Operating System Kernel Skeleton

For NSU CSE323 (Operating Systems) Project. Originally compild in NASM and emulated with QEMU.

This consists of three main sections: bootloader, 16-to-32-bit converter and the basic OS kernel. Unfortunately, 2/3 of the systems don't actually work properly. Assembly more like pain-in-my-ass-embly. The basic structure and code are based off cfenollossa's OS Tutorial. I suppose I'll come back to this one day when I actually have time and fix it.

Ideally, this would've been a fully functional skeleton for an Operating System, with several basic functions written into the kernel.c file that the OS could execute.
